================

Kinetis L - gpio demo using CMSIS files, ARM GCC.

### BASIC INFO
Please build the demo using the makefile, flash openSDA with CMSIS-DAP interface shared on mbed site. KL25Z has official CMSIS-DAP interface, find it on mbed. For the rest of the freedom platforms, visit link for CMSIS-DAP "testing" versions
[mbed.org CMSIS-DAP for the freedom platform](http://mbed.org/users/Kojto/notebook/cmsis-dap-for-the-freedom-platform-kl05-kl25-kl46-/).

Once they will be officially released, I'll add a link here.

Then just copy the output .bin file to the msd drive on your computer (named mbed). The LED should be blinking.
